# Basic WordPress NGINX MariaDB Docker for Local

A local dev environment with WP, Nginx and SSL based on https://github.com/urre/wordpress-nginx-docker-compose with bedrock/roots removed

Requires mkcert to use mkcert-create-cert script (https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) I added this as I was having issues with Chrome trusting the self signed ssl on Ubuntu with the create-cert script.
